<h1>About Hobbies</h1>
<p1>A hobby is considered to be a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time. Hobbies include collecting themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. Participation in hobbies encourages acquiring substantial skills and knowledge in that area. A list of hobbies changes with renewed interests and developing fashions, making it diverse and lengthy. Hobbies tend to follow trends in society. For example, stamp collecting was popular during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as postal systems were the main means of communication; as of 2023, video games became more popular following technological advances. The advancing production and technology of the nineteenth century provided workers with more leisure time to engage in hobbies. Because of this, the efforts of people investing in hobbies has increased with time.<br>

Hobbyists may be identified under three sub-categories: casual leisure which is intrinsically rewarding, short-lived, pleasurable activity requiring little or no preparation, serious leisure which is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer that is substantial, rewarding and results in a sense of accomplishment, and finally project-based leisure which is a short-term, often one-off, project that is rewarding.[1]

Etymology

Writing and editing articles for Wikipedia is a hobby for some people.
In the 16th century, the term "hobby" had the meaning of "small horse and pony". The term "hobby horse" was documented in a 1557 payment confirmation for a "Hobbyhorse" from Reading, England.[2] The item, originally called a "Tourney Horse", was made of a wooden or basketwork frame with an artificial tail and head. It was designed for a child to mimic riding a real horse. By 1816 the derivative, "hobby", was introduced into the vocabulary of a number of English people.[3] Over the course of subsequent centuries, the term came to be associated with recreation and leisure. In the 17th century, the term was used in a pejorative sense by suggesting that a hobby was a childish pursuit, however, in the 18th century with more industrial society and more leisure time, hobbies took on greater respectability.[4] A hobby is also called a pastime, derived from the use of hobbies to pass the time. A hobby became an activity that is practiced regularly and usually with some worthwhile purpose.[4] Hobbies are usually, but not always, practiced primarily for interest and enjoyment, rather than financial reward.

History
Prior to the mid-19th century, hobbies were generally considered as an obsession, childish or trivial, with negative connotations.[5] However, as early as 1676 Sir Matthew Hale, in Contemplations Moral and Divine, wrote "Almost every person hath some hobby horse or other wherein he prides himself."[6] He was acknowledging that a "hobby horse" produces a legitimate sense of pride. The cultural shift towards acceptance of hobbies was thought to begin during the mid 18th century as working people had more regular hours of work and greater leisure time, spending more time to pursue interests that brought them satisfaction.[4] However, there was concern that these working people might not use their leisure time in worthwhile pursuits. "The hope of weaning people away from bad habits by the provision of counter-attractions came to the fore in the 1830s, and has rarely waned since. Initially, the bad habits were perceived to be of a sensual and physical nature, and the counter attractions, or perhaps more accurately alternatives, deliberately cultivated rationality and the intellect."[7] The book and magazine trade of the day encouraged worthwhile hobbies and pursuits. The burgeoning manufacturing trade made materials used in hobbies cheap and was responsive to the changing interests of hobbyists.

In 1941, George Orwell identified hobbies as central to English culture at the time: "Another English characteristic which is so much a part of us that we barely notice it … is the addiction to hobbies and spare-time occupations, the privateness of English life. We are a nation of flower-lovers, but also a nation of stamp-collectors, pigeon-fanciers, amateur carpenters, coupon-snippers, darts-players, crossword-puzzle fans. All the culture that is most truly native centers round things which even when they are communal are not official—the pub, the football match, the back garden, the fireside and the 'nice cup of tea'."[8]

Deciding what to include in a list of hobbies provokes debate because it is difficult to decide which pleasurable pass-times can also be described as hobbies. During the 20th century the term hobby suggested activities, such as stamp collecting, embroidery, knitting, painting, woodwork, and photography. Typically the description did not include activities like listening to music, watching television, or reading. These latter activities bring pleasure, but lack the sense of achievement usually associated with a hobby. They are usually not structured, organized pursuits, as most hobbies are. The pleasure of a hobby is usually associated with making something of value or achieving something of value. "Such leisure is socially valorized precisely because it produces feelings of satisfaction with something that looks very much like work but that is done of its own sake."[4] "Hobbies are a contradiction: they take work and turn it into leisure, and take leisure and turn it into work."[4] A 2018 study using survey results identified the term "hobby" to most accurately describe activities associated with making or collecting objects, especially when done alone.[5]<br>

Cultural trends related to hobbies change with time. In the 21st century, the video game industry has been popular as a hobby involving millions of children and adults. Stamp collecting declined along with the importance of the postal system. Woodwork and knitting declined as hobbies, because manufactured goods provide cheap alternatives for handmade goods. Through the internet, an online community has become a hobby for many people; sharing advice, information and support, and in some cases, allowing a traditional hobby, such as collecting, to flourish and support trading in a new environment.[citation needed]

Hobbyists
Hobbyists are a part of a wider group of people engaged in leisure pursuits where the boundaries of each group overlap to some extent. The Serious Leisure Perspective[9] groups hobbyists with amateurs and volunteers and identifies three broad groups of leisure activity with hobbies being found mainly in the Serious leisure category. Casual leisure is intrinsically rewarding, short-lived, pleasurable activity requiring little or no preparation. Serious leisure is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer that is substantial, rewarding and results in a sense of accomplishment. Finally, project-based leisure is a short-term often a one-off project that is rewarding.[1]

The terms amateur and hobbyist are often used interchangeably. Stebbins[9] has a framework which distinguishes the terms in a useful categorization of leisure in which casual leisure is separated from serious Leisure. He describes serious leisure as undertaken by amateurs, hobbyists and volunteers. Amateurs engage in pursuits that have a professional counterpart, such as playing an instrument or astronomy. Hobbyists engage in five broad types of activity: collecting, making and tinkering (like embroidery and car restoration), activity participation (like fishing and singing), sports and games, and liberal-arts hobbies (like languages, cuisine, literature). Volunteers commit to organizations where they work as guides, counsellors, gardeners and so on. The separation of the amateur from the hobbyist is because the amateur has the ethos of the professional practitioner as a guide to practice. An amateur clarinetist is conscious of the role and procedures of a professional clarinetist.


There are people who enjoy motorcycle touring alone or in groups, and there are also club teams.
A large proportion of hobbies are mainly solitary in nature.[4]: 28  However, individual pursuit of a hobby often includes club memberships, organized sharing of products and regular communication between participants. For many hobbies there is an important role in being in touch with fellow hobbyists. Some hobbies are of communal nature, like choral singing and volunteering.

People who engage in hobbies have an interest in and time to pursue them. Children have been an important group of hobbyists because they are enthusiastic for collecting, making and exploring, in addition to this they have the leisure time that allows them to pursue those hobbies. The growth in hobbies occurred during industrialization which gave workers set time for leisure. During the Depression there was an increase in the participation in hobbies because the unemployed had the time and a desire to be purposefully occupied.[10] Hobbies are often pursued with an increased interest by retired people because they have the time and seek the intellectual and physical stimulation a hobby provides.<br>

Types of hobbies
Hobbies are a diverse set of activities and it is difficult to categorize them in a logical manner. The following categorization of hobbies was developed by Stebbins.[1]

Collecting includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying and storing.[4] Collecting is appealing to many people due to their interest in a particular subject and a desire to categorize and make order out of complexity. Some collectors are generalists, accumulating items from countries of the world. Others focus on a subtopic within their area of interest, perhaps 19th century postage stamps, milk bottle labels from Sussex, or Mongolian harnesses and tack, Firearms (both modern and vintage).

Collecting is an ancient hobby, with the list of coin collectors showing Caesar Augustus as one. Sometimes collectors have turned their hobby into a business, becoming commercial dealers that trade in the items being collected.

An alternative to collecting physical objects is collecting records of events of a particular kind. Examples include train spotting, bird-watching, aircraft spotting, and any other form of systematic recording a particular phenomenon. The recording form can be written, photographic, online, etc.

Making and tinkering

Making and tinkering includes working on self-motivated projects for fulfillment. These projects may be progressive, irregular tasks performed over a long period of time.[1] Making and Tinkering hobbies include higher-end projects, such as building or restoring a car or building a computer from individual parts, like CPUs and SSDs. For computer savvy do-it-yourself hobbyists, CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining may also be popular. A CNC machine can be assembled and programmed to make different parts from wood or metal.

Tinkering is 'dabbling' with the making process, often applied to the hobby of tinkering with car repairs, and various kinds of restoration: of furniture, antique cars, etc. It also applies to household tinkering: repairing a wall, laying a pathway, etc. Examples of Making and Tinkering hobbies include Scale modeling, model engineering, 3D printing, dressmaking, and cooking.

Scale modeling is making a replica of a real-life object in a smaller scale and dates back to prehistoric times with small clay "dolls" and other children's toys that have been found near known populated areas. Some of the earliest scale models of residences were found in Cucuteni–Trypillia culture in Eastern Europe. These artifacts were dated to be around 3000–6000 BC.[11] Similar models dating back to the same period were found in ancient Egypt, India, China and Mesopotamia archaeological sites.[11]

At the turn of the Industrial Age and through the 1920s, some families could afford things such as electric trains, wind-up toys (typically boats or cars) and the increasingly valuable tin toy soldiers. Scale modeling as we know it today became popular shortly after World War II. Before 1946, children as well as adults were content in carving and shaping wooden replicas from block wood kits, often depicting enemy aircraft to help with identification in case of an invasion.[citation needed]

With the advent of modern plastics, the amount of skill required to get the basic shape accurately shown for any given subject was lessened, making it easier for people of all ages to begin assembling replicas in varying scales. Superheroes, aero planes, boats, cars, tanks, artillery, and even figures of soldiers became quite popular subjects to build, paint and display. Although almost any subject can be found in almost any scale, there are common scales for such miniatures which remain constant today.

Model engineering refers to building functioning machinery in metal, such as internal combustion motors and live steam models or locomotives. This is a demanding hobby that requires a multitude of large and expensive machine tools, such as lathes and mills. This hobby originated in the United Kingdom in the late 19th century, later spreading and flourishing in the mid-20th century. Due to the expense and space required, it is becoming rare.

3D Printing is a relatively new technology and already a major hobby as the cost of printers has fallen sharply. It is a good example of how hobbyists quickly engage with new technologies, communicate with one another and become producers related to their former hobby. 3D modeling is the process of making mathematical representations of three dimensional items and is an aspect of 3D printing.

Dressmaking has been a major hobby up until the late 20th century, in order to make cheap clothes, but also as a creative design and craft challenge. It has been reduced by the low cost of manufactured clothes.

Cooking is for some people an interest, a hobby, a challenge and a source of significant satisfaction. For many other people it is a job, a chore, a duty, like cleaning. In the early 21st century the importance of cooking as a hobby was demonstrated by the high popularity of competitive television cooking programs.

Activity participation includes partaking in "non-competitive, rule-based pursuits."[1]

Outdoor pursuits are the group of activities which occur outdoors. These hobbies include gardening, hill walking, hiking, backpacking, cycling, canoeing, climbing, caving, fishing, hunting, target shooting (informal or formal), wildlife viewing (as birdwatching) and engaging in watersports and snowsports.


Gardening
One large subset of outdoor pursuits is gardening. Residential gardening most often takes place in or about one's own residence, in a space referred to as the garden. Although a garden typically is located on the land near a residence, it may also be located on a roof, in an atrium, on a balcony, in a windowbox, or on a patio or vivarium.

Gardening also takes place in non-residential green areas, such as parks, public or semi-public gardens (botanical gardens or zoological gardens), amusement and theme parks, along transportation corridors, and around tourist attractions and hotels. In these situations, a staff of gardeners or groundskeepers maintains the gardens.


A variety of flowers and vegetables in an indoor garden
Indoor gardening is concerned with growing houseplants within a residence or building, in a conservatory, or in a greenhouse. Indoor gardens are sometimes incorporated into air conditioning or heating systems.

Water gardening is concerned with growing plants that have adapted to pools and ponds, along with aqua-scaping in planted aquariums. Bog gardens are also considered a type of water garden. A simple water garden may consist solely of a tub containing the water and plants.

Container gardening is concerned with growing plants in containers that are placed above the ground.

Many hobbies involve performances by the hobbyist, such as singing, acting, juggling, magic, dancing, playing a musical instrument, martial arts, and other performing arts.

Some hobbies may result in an end product. Examples of this would be woodworking, photography, moviemaking, jewelry making, software projects such as Photoshopping and home music or video production, making bracelets, artistic projects such as drawing, painting, Cosplay (design, creation, and wearing a costume based on an already existing creative property), creating models out of card stock or paper – called papercraft. Many of these fall under the category visual arts.

Writing is often taken up as a hobby by aspiring writers and usually appears in the form of personal blog, guest posting or fan fiction (literary art resulting in creation of written content based on already existing, licensed creative property under specified terms).[12]

Reading books, eBooks, magazines, comics, or newspapers, along with browsing the internet is a common hobby, and one that can trace its origins back hundreds of years. A love of literature, later in life, may be sparked by an interest in reading children's literature as a child. Many of these fall under the category literary arts.

Knitting or Crocheting is a calming and productive hobby. It allows for creativity while making cozy items like scarves, blankets, or hats. It's easy on the joints and can be done at a leisurely pace, making it perfect for staying engaged and creating thoughtful gifts.

Sports and games
Main article: Sport
Main article: Game
Stebbins[1] distinguishes an amateur sports person and a hobbyist by suggesting a hobbyist plays in less formal sports, or games that are rule bound and have no professional equivalent. While an amateur sports individual plays a sport with a professional equivalent, such as football or tennis. Amateur sport may range from informal play to highly competitive practice, such as deck tennis or long distance trekking.

The Department for Culture, Media, and Support in England suggests that playing sports benefits physical and mental health. A positive relationship appeared between engaging in sports and improving overall health.[13]

Psychological role
During the 20th century there was extensive research into the important role that play has in human development. While most evident in childhood, play continues throughout life for many adults in the form of games, hobbies, and sport.[14] Moreover, studies of aging and society support the value of hobbies in healthy aging.[15]</p1>

<h2>My Favourite Hobby</h2>
<p2>Physical Health Benefits of Playing Guitar
1. Reduces Chronic Pain
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 50 million Americans are living with chronic pain. If you suffer on a daily basis, music could act as natural pain relief.

A study conducted by researchers at the University of Utah Pain Research Center found that “music provided meaningful intellectual and emotional engagement to help reduce pain.”

While simply listening to music can provide temporary relief, playing guitar will engage your brain and take your mind off your symptoms, potentially resulting in decreased pain.

Keep in mind that new guitarists tend to deal with finger pain initially. This helpful guide from Healthline will help you keep your digits pain-free and in tiptop shape.

2. Prevents High Blood Pressure
Practicing guitar could have similar benefits to physical exercise. In fact, an encouraging study conducted at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands found that actively making music lowered participants’ heart rate and blood pressure.


I don’t know about you, but I’d much rather jam on my guitar than sweat it out at the gym!

3. Improves Hand-Eye Coordination

Many daily tasks require using the eyes and hands simultaneously. Playing guitar requires both fine and gross motor skills, so every time you pick up your instrument, you’re strengthening these skills.

Although hand-eye coordination takes time to develop, you’ll likely be surprised by how fast your skills improve. For a confidence boost, I recommend recording your jam sessions to keep track of your progress. Trust me: Listening to your developing talent will be a great motivator!

4. Increases Flexibility
Playing guitar requires flexibility, but there’s no need to worry if you’re not particularly flexible… There are countless resources to help! My favorite? This user-friendly guide from guitarhabits.com, which walks guitarists through eight stretches to increase their flexibility. There is tab underneath if you can’t read sheet music.


Even as a seasoned musician, I do these stretches pretty often. You’ll notice your flexibility improving the longer you play the guitar—and the more advanced you become. The key is consistent practice and allowing your flexibility to increase at its own pace.

5. Enhances Hearing
Your sense of hearing is bound to improve once you start practicing guitar. Playing an instrument requires knowing if your instrument is correctly tuned and recognizing differences in sounds.

Along your guitar-playing journey, I recommend familiarizing yourself with ear training, which will help you play and listen to music in a completely different way! If you’re interested in reading more about ear training, I recommend this great virtual lesson by Justin Guitar, in which he covers seven ear-training benefits.

Mental Health Benefits of Playing Guitar
benefits-of-playing-guitar-1a

6. Reduces Stress
It’s a well-known fact that music has a calming effect. The Mayo Clinic even recommends music for stress relief, along with physical activity, a healthy diet, meditation, laughter, and sleep.

So, why is playing or listening to music calming? It relieves tension, lowers stress hormones, and serves as a welcome distraction. I personally love that the recipe for a calmer, more content lifestyle includes picking up my guitar daily (and plenty of z’s).

7. Stimulates the Brain
It may seem obvious that playing an instrument would boost brainpower, but it’s stimulating in so many fascinating and surprising ways!


According to a study conducted by researchers at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, musicians have a knack for recognizing and correcting errors. Plus, those who play an instrument regularly may be less likely to experience a decline in their mental functioning.

Unsurprisingly, musicians also tend to have faster response times while simultaneously maintaining accuracy.

8. Encourages Expression of Emotions
Playing music is an excellent way to express emotions, and I’ve never met a musician who isn’t passionate about their art.

Have you ever noticed how a single song can shift your mood or change the course of your day? Playing music is no different. If you need a pick-me-up after a rough shift at work, opt for upbeat tunes. And if you’re feeling mellow, choose calm, relaxing songs to coincide with your peaceful vibe.

9. Improves Happiness and Overall Wellbeing

When we engage in activities we love, our happiness baseline begins to improve. Sure, this is a slow process, but wouldn’t you love to be happier in the long run?

Hobbies can help us get through tough times—and appreciate the good times. Music is especially uplifting, as it stimulates multiple senses. If you’re anything like me, the act of picking up your guitar gives you a little endorphin rush. It’s a daily highlight I simply can’t live without. Let’s face it: Playing guitar is addictive in the best possible way!

10. Sparks Creativity
If you’re looking to develop a creative flair, playing music could lead you there! According to an article published by colatoday.com, “People who take piano lessons [or] guitar lessons are… much more creative and imaginative.”


In essence, learning to play guitar—or another instrument—sparks the brain to form new, exciting ideas. This process takes place in multiple areas of the brain, including the frontal cortex and hippocampus.

11. Expands Knowledge Base
When you pick up your first guitar, chances are you’ll want to learn everything there is to know about this amazing instrument. You’ll expand your knowledge base by memorizing chords, taking in new information, and broadening your horizons.

Guitarists are often drawn to fellow musicians, and there’s always something to learn. If you’re open to ongoing learning, you’ll be a student for life.

12. Encourages Mindfulness
guitar and mindfulness

Playing guitar is a great way to get out of your head and become more mindful of the present. If you tend to dwell on past events and/or stress about the future, practicing an instrument will help you live in the moment.

You don’t have to be an advanced guitar player to start developing a more mindful approach to life. Learning new chords and songs will train your brain to bask in the here and now. It’s difficult to dwell or worry when you’re focused on your hobby.

13. Enhances Intelligence
Did you know that learning to play a musical instrument could boost your IQ by up to seven points? That’s right… picking up that guitar could actually make you smarter!

As you continue learning, different parts of your brain will take in new information. Not only will this process make you a great guitarist; it’ll also increase your intelligence.

14. Keeps the Mind Sharp
Since playing guitar requires continuous learning, your mind will always be engaged. Practicing your instrument could actually protect you from cognitive decline, which is incredibly important as we age.

According to an illuminating 2009 study, a decline in cognition tends to start in early adulthood and continues to progress as we get older. There’s no better motivator to keep picking, is there?

15. Boosts Confidence

Confidence is key when it comes to moving forward and working toward our goals. Learning a new skill can lead to new opportunities, and mastering the guitar is a fantastic avenue to take.

As your confidence increases, you’ll be more open to meeting new people and seeking out new adventures. Who knows? You might even find yourself gracing a stage someday!

16. Leads to Feelings of Success
I’m a big proponent of celebrating accomplishments, and learning to play guitar is definitely something to celebrate! I highly recommend basking in your success, rewarding yourself for reaching small and big milestones, and allowing yourself to enjoy the entire process.

Because learning to play an instrument requires lots of ongoing learning, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to revel in your success. I encourage you to enjoy every moment!

17. Improves Patience
It’s virtually impossible to learn to play guitar without developing better patience. Even if you feel like an innately impatient person, your dedication to your instrument will prove otherwise.

You’ll likely notice an improvement in many areas of your life as you become a more patient individual. The skills and traits we develop from playing guitar often carry over into our daily lives.

Social Benefits of Playing Guitar
benefits-of-playing-guitar-1b

18. Encourages New Bonds
Forming connections with other people is so much easier when you share a common bond. When you form friendships with other musicians, you’ll feel a sense of belonging and, best of all, you’ll never run out of interesting things to talk about!

While music is timeless, it’s also ever-changing, making it a great conversation starter. After all, studies have shown music to have a positive impact on all living things!

19. Expands the Social Circle
Whether you have a big group of friends or you tend to be a loner, playing guitar is a great way to grow your social circle. According to an article published by Medical News Today, face-to-face interaction can help build resiliency to stress. In other words, socializing can actually make us healthier. How cool is that?

If you’re taking lessons from an instructor, ask about the best spots for live music in your area, or simply follow local bars and clubs on social media for updates on upcoming events. Who knows… you may end up playing for a crowd!

20. Combines the Most Important Things in Life
Playing guitar, and delving further into your love for music, is the perfect way to combine the things you cherish most in life. Invite your friends along to local music events, and be sure to introduce your loved ones to fellow musicians. Enthusiasm is contagious, so don’t be afraid to show your excitement for your newfound hobby.

21. Encourages Helping Others
One of the best aspects of playing guitar is passing your knowledge onto others. Once you’ve mastered the basics, you’ll have the ability to teach family members and friends everything you’ve learned. You can also offer lessons to troubled teens or adults. Sharing your gift for playing guitar will make you feel downright amazing!


22. Teaches Collaboration
In many cases, collaborating with other musicians leads to long-term success. It’s difficult to learn guitar in a bubble, as virtually every musician can offer valuable tips and helpful hints.

If you’re lucky enough to jam with fellow local musicians, you’ll quickly learn tricks that will catapult you to the next level of your guitar-playing journey. If you’re learning from an instructor, don’t hesitate to ask questions. It’s also important to welcome constructive feedback.

If you happen to be learning to play guitar virtually, reach out for help from the online guitarist. If you haven’t noticed already, this community is generally eager to offer assistance to new musicians. There is always help available.

23. Piques Others’ Interest
benefits-of-playing-guitar-1d

When your world expands, you instantly become more interesting. People will undoubtedly ask about your love for guitars, which will give you the perfect excuse to show off your skills and spark others’ interest in the hobby.

If you haven’t found that special someone, your guitar-playing skills might just open the door to a new relationship. Stepping out of your comfort zone will likely expand well beyond learning guitar. It could open up a whole new world of possibilities.

24. Encourages Online Connection
If you haven’t created an Instagram or TikTok account to share your passion for guitar playing, now is the time to go virtual! Technology allows us to share our interests and gifts with the world, and social media is one of the best ways to find inspiration.

More Benefits Associated with Playing Guitar
25. Encourages Discipline
Learning to play guitar takes dedication and commitment. You’ll want to practice on a regular basis to build finger strength and stamina.


I’ve always considered it a good idea to make music a daily practice, but rest assured that missing a day here and there won’t stunt your success.

The amount of time you spend strumming shouldn’t be your primary focus. An article published by Fender highlights the importance of deliberate, focused practice. I’d add that consistency is key. If practicing guitar becomes part of your daily routine, you’ll be less likely to skip it.

26. Improves Time Management
As mentioned above, playing guitar doesn’t necessarily require a major time commitment, but fitting it in may be difficult if you have a busy schedule. I recommend penciling in your practice sessions just like you would when scheduling an important appointment.

27. Improves Reading Skills
learning to play guitar

When you learn to play guitar, you’re learning a brand new language. You’ll learn to listen for subtle cues in order to reproduce what you hear. You’ll pick up on nuances that will change how you listen to music.

As you learn to transfer notes from the page to your fingers, be sure to practice patience. Learning a new language takes time, and music is certainly no exception.

28. Boosts Math Performance
It’s no secret that music and math go together like peas and carrots. Playing a musical instrument requires sequencing and rhythm. This informative post on TrueFire’s blog explains the correlation between mathematics and octaves, half steps, and tuning.

29. Leads to Goal-Setting
If follow-through isn’t your strong suit, your guitar might just be the key to reaching your goals. The pride and achievement you feel from learning a new lick or mastering the minor scale will lead to more goal-setting, both short-term and long-term.


The best part of setting guitar-playing goals? It will make you a better musician.

30. Can Lead to Increased Income
There are numerous ways to make money once you’re a seasoned guitarist. Offering lessons is a great way to make extra cash. Songwriting and ghostwriting can also be quite lucrative if you’re good at your craft.

You can also keep an eye out for companies looking for honest reviews, which is an excellent way to try new guitar-related products. In some cases, you’ll even get reimbursed for your time.

Offering workshops is a quick moneymaker; plus, you’ll have the satisfaction of sharing your expertise with novice musicians. These workshops can be offered locally, or you can offer them online to reach a wider audience.

31. Can Lead to Amazing Adventures and Experiences

Your love for all things guitar-related could lead to a surge in your sense of adventure. You’ll likely end up travelling far and wide for gigs and studio recording sessions.

You’ve probably heard Brad Henry’s quote, “The only thing holding us back is ourselves.” Music is no exception. If you dream of expanding your musical knowledge, stepping out of your comfort zone could lead to some amazing life experiences!

32. Offers Insight into Other Cultures
As you learn new music styles, you’ll likely wonder where specific songs originated. Musicians often take a deep dive into music history, thanks to their keen sense of curiosity. By researching songs, you’ll gain new insight about various cultures, and your appreciation for new styles could result in an increase in your musical tastes.</p2>
